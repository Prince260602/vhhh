        TEN - The Entrepreneurship Networkâ€™s virtual incubation program supports  startups annually, tailored for early to mid-stage startups seeking a boost and valuable connections. The program fosters an ideal environment for growth by offering a Startup Kit and linking companies with our extensive network of evaluators and mentors, including investors, accelerators, and seasoned industry experts.
        </p>
        <p>
        As one of the largest programs of its kind, it attracts a high volume of applications. The selection process involves two rounds of screening conducted by regional leads and our committee, which includes external stakeholders. To speed up the process and minimize waiting times, we now accept startups into the virtual incubator on a monthly basis.
